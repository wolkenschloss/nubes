## The vision

*Wolkenschloss* (Cloud Castle) is a group of independent services for a private
Cloud, with which everyday tasks of private life are supported.

Possible services would be for example

* **Blog**
* To do list
* Calendar
* Contacts
* **Cookbook with recipes**
* File management comparable to Google Drive, OneDrive, and Nextcloud for
    - Documents
    - Media such as movies, photos and music
    - workflows

Central Services:

* User administration
    - User account with profile
    - User rights
    - Registration and deregistration
    - Central registration and authorization also for the devices in the home network.
* Backup and Restore
* Logging
* Monitoring

## installation

* TBD *

*Wolkenschloss* should be accessible to as many as possible. The installation
should therefore be as simple as possible, even for laypeople. Ideas are: *

- Image for Raspberry PI
- Docker-Compose installation
- Kubernetes installation
- Virtual machine
